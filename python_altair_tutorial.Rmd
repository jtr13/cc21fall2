# Python Altair Visualization Method Tutorial

Anne Lin (Anqi Lin)

Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. It offers a powerful and concise visualization grammar that enables users to build a wide range of statistical visualizations quickly and simply.

Therefore, I created a tutorial template for common use of Altair for data visualization. The link for the tutorial is as follows:
