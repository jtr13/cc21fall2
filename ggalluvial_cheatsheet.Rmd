I have chosen ggalluvial package as my topic. 

First, I described what ggalluvial is and what its function is. 

Then I introduced it from two aspect since there are two Format of alluvial graph: Wide format and Lodes(Long) Format. 

After introducing the basic information and code, I also make some changes to the basic graph which can help analyst more efficiently analyze the data from different aspects.
