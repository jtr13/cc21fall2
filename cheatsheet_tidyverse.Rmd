# Cheatsheet Tidyverse

Jiazhen Li




## 

This is cheatsheet for helping students who start to learn analysis of graph with R. In the class, we learn the tidyverse, a powerful collection of R packages. In this cheatsheet, I pay more attention on two packages: ggplot2 and dplyr. I specifically list functions of dylyr we frequently use and the grammer of graphics in ggplot2 packages. This will be useful for new student to learn.
