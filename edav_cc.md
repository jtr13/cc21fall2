# Textbook Notes

Xianmeng Wang

This is the summary note from course textbook "Graphical Data Analysis", not from the course EDAV itself. Many contents are overlapped between these two but there are still a number of significant difference. This textbook note only covers the contents from Chapter 3 to Chapter 11 since Chapter 1 and 2 are introductions and contents after Chapter 12 are more likely to be summaries and introduction to R, which will not be covered in this file.
