# Cheat Sheet to Score 100 Points

Sharmi Mathur and Ayush Baral

##Motivation:

The motivation behind this small cheat sheet was that the future as well as current
students would have a reference guide so that their points do not get taken off for
silly reasons.

###Things Learned:

The project helped us to look over our mistakes from the assignments. It gave us
brilliant feedback for what errors we had made in the past and provided us with an
opportunity to learn from our mistakes. And what steps we should take going
forward so that these mistakes do not occur again.
