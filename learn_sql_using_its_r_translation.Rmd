# Learning SQL with Its R dplyr Translation

Hang Xu (hx2321)

Students are usually familiar with R and Python as we use them very often in Statistic classes. However, most of the Data Science and Data Analyst interviews test our SQL skills where SQL is mostly used in the industry when pulling data from companies' database. Thus, I would like to provide a one page Cheat Sheet introduces SQL with its R translation for better understanding. The purpose is that students can know the corresponding syntax in SQL when they are trying to overcome the interview questions.

> - There is a pdf file containing the cheat sheet. 
>
> - There is also a readme file which better explains my motivation.
