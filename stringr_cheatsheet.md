# String Manipulation in R

Xiaoyi Zhang

Making informative charts and graphs is a common way to get actionable insights from our datasets. However, often times, our data, especially those in the form of strings, are not cleaned in the format we want. Therefore, I create this cheat sheet for basic string manipulations such as creating a string, escaping special characters, joining multiple strings, and matching strings with pattern in R.
