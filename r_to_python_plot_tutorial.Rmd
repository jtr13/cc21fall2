# R to python easy plot

Sandy Chen and Yixuan Liu

Our notebook discusses the way to generate all graphs in the class in python. During this process, we learned a lot of Python commands that allow us to produce similar graphs we learned in class. For instance, we explored functions like facet_wrap in Python. We also explored how to plot histograms, dot plot, box plot, density Plot, qq plot and ridgeplot in the Python.
