# Community contribution assignment

GR5702

This fairly open-ended assignment provides an opportunity to receive credit for contributing to the collective learning of the class, and perhaps beyond. It should reflect a minimum of 3 hours of work. To complete the assignment you must submit a short description of your contribution. If appropriate, attach relevant files.  

There are many ways in which you can contribute:

* lead a Zoom conversation on anything: hobby, happy hour, etc. Think about how you will organize it... do students need to sign up? Will you have breakout rooms?
* help students find final project partners
* give a well-rehearsed 5 minute lightning talk in class on a datavis topic (theory or tool) (email me to set the date -- it may be after the assignment due date but you need to schedule it before)
* create a video tutorial (any length) 
* create a cheatsheet or other resource
* be a Piazza super user (that is, answer a lot of questions)
* write a tutorial for a tool that's not well documented
* translate a useful resource into another language
* build a viz product (ex. htmlwidget) for class use
* create a web site for sharing class resources publicly
* provide significant subject matter help to a classmate
* organize and lead a help session on a particular topic (the date may be after the assignment due date but you need to schedule it before)
* [your own idea]


You may draw on and expand existing resources.  When doing so, it is critical that you cite your sources.

## Logistics

### Groups

You may work on your own or with a partner of your choosing. If you work alone, you do not need to join a group of 1, you simply submit your work on CourseWorks as with any other solo assignment. 

If you work with a partner, add yourselves to a group on the CC page on the People tab. Piazza can be used to find partners with similar interests.

### Submitting your assignment

You must submit your assignment twice: once on CourseWorks (so it can be graded) and once to the class, details to follow.

1. CourseWorks submission: submit your work as an .Rmd and rendered .pdf or .html file, just as with problem sets. If your work does not lend itself to that format, then write in the assignment text box what you did.

2. Class (GitHub) submission: see [the next chapter](instructions.html).
