# Get NBA dataset in R

Yanbing Chen

## Motivation

My final project for this course is analysis on professional basketball, more specifically, the transformation of game style of professional basketball. Having a great dataset is a prerequisite for the project but the official dataset is only viewable on NBA.com but not available for downloading as csv file. Fortunately, there is a useful package in R called 'nbastatR'. Hence, while I am trying to explore the package in R, it is also great to complete this tutorial to share the information and help others who are also interested in NBA or basketball analysis in R.

The thing needed to be noticed that the package might not satisfy your all needs for the project. There are other ways to obtain the data, such as scraping data from NBA official website using python, which I am also investing on.

Since there are a lot of functions in the package to use, I will mainly focus on the functions related to my topic. For more information, please refer to  https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/nbastatR/versions/0.1.110202031 and the package maintainer Alex Bresler.

## Guides to Functions

Here are several examples for me to approach the goal of my analysis by using the package.

1. By looking at players drafted in each year, we could figure out what kind of players teams wanted in the past and nowadays.
```{r eval=FALSE}
drafts(draft_years = 2000:2010)
```

2. By looking at total point leader in each season, we could discover how the games are changing, maybe from dominating by centers to guards.
```{r eval=FALSE}
metrics_leaders(seasons = 2000:2010,
                metric = "pts",
                season_types = "Regular Season",
                modes = "PerGame")
```

3. By examining the shot chart, we could find some trends about shooting such as longer shot distance.
```{r eval=FALSE}
teams_shots(teams = "Brooklyn Nets", seasons = 2000:2010)
```

4. By summarizing the total points each season, we might see some changes to the speed of plays in a game.
```{r eval=FALSE}
teams_annual_stats(teams = "New York Knicks",modes = c("Totals"))
```
