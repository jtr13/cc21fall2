# Introduction to Log-transformation

Shanzhao Qiao, Yijia Jin

The community contribution for our team is to create a cheatsheet for the topic of log transformation.
Our work is to create a comprehensive guidance regarding log-transformation, with theoretical analysis, examples of manipulated dataset with plots and visualizations, real-world examples, and some thoughts about situations that can not be applied to. 

The PDF version of the guidance and explanation could be found at: 
'resources/intro_to_log_transformation/intro_log_transf_final.pdf'

Or in the following github repo:
