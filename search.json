Cleveland, named ‘Visualizing Data’ (Cleveland W. S. (1993). “Visualizing Data”. Hobart Press.). Since brand new package, documents produced illustrate proper usage . document, show power package necessary explanations useful functions specific examples. specifically, use fastfood dataset reflect understandings algorithms package. original book William S. Cleveland main source also rough document CRAN reference. Package source can found ‘https://github.com/mpru/ggcleveland’. salute author Marcos Prunello marcosprunello@gmail.com.\nmay find original tutorials really compact lack vivid examples, purpose like give specific explanation ggcleveland. Indeed, also many useful datasets package like fusion, fly, etc. introduce document.\nequal_count\nfunction applies equal count algorithm divide set observations intervals \ncan certain level ovelapping. see following example intuitive comprehension.\n\nInputs: df: dataframe, vble: variable df need divided, n_int: number intervals result, frac: overlapping fraction required result.\nOutputs: can see example, two tables, first one shows divided groups variable fastfood\\(calories* counts overlaps (next group) group. shows corresponding dataframe original *fastfood* two columns added. *id* represents position original daraframe *intervel* indicates group belongs division. may find size dataframe increases 515 567, due overlapping observations, .e. observation appears many times number intervals belongs. Properties: may find groups divided *equal_count* algorithm monotonously increasing order *fastfood\\)calories. Moreover, note new dataframe returns arranged class fastfood$restaurant. Hence, using method, can simply generate dataframe show level calories different restaurant using skills ggplot2 package, see\n\nAlthough may find original histogram plot can also reflect level comparison calories different restaurant, histogram based equal_count implies information, e.g. Subway foods likely two extremes, either high-level calories low-level calories.\ngg_coplot\nfunction implements conditional plots, particularly powerful visualization tool studying response depends two factors. concretely, following examples, simple coplot example first plot. Moreover, can find difference relation plot conditional relation plot next two plots. Given (Conditioning ) total_fat, sat_fat trans_fat seem explicitly uniform relation compared result non-conditional plot. Hence, gg_coplot useful us determine conditional independence variables.\n\nexplanations important parameters function.\nInputs: df: dataframe, x: variable x-axis, y: variable y-axis, faceting: faceting numeric variable, number_bins: number groups required divide faceting variable, overlap: overlapping fraction required faceting variable result.\nOutputs: coplot (conditional plot)\n\nplot shows wealth information dependence sat_fat trans_fat. total, conditioning total_fat nonlinear pattern. Except subplot (2,2) (3,3), patterns seem positive correlation sat_fat trans_fat given total_fat. However, subplots (2,2) (3,3) fail conclusion also difference . Hence, part interaction two factors, words, seems uniform effect sat_fat trans_fat. sake comparison, let us see example conditional dependence follow.\nCoplots intervals must chosen compromise two competing criteria, .e. number points resolution. one side, lengths must sufficiently great dependence panels enough points effects seen, points dependence panel, noise data typically prevents points coalescing meaningful pattern. side, lengths must small enough maintain reasonable resolution, conditioning interval big, risk distorted view nature dependence changes dramatically value conditioning factor changes within interval.gg_pt\nfunction returns normal QQ plots set power transformations. Indeed, choose power value 1, returns exactly QQ plot, shown following example.\n\nInputs: df: dataframe, vble: variable need transformation, taus: vector values power transformations. Note 0-power transformation log transformation, .e. Power transformations class transformations includes logarithm.\nOutputs: corresponding QQ plot power transformation given power values.\nfollowing plots examples related different power transformation values.\n\nsimple power transformation applied plot, may find something interesting, example, may find power transformation brings distribution closest symmetry based property QQ plot. fastfood$calories case, best parameter seems 0.25 0.50, see .\ngg_rf\ngg_rf one practical functions package gg_cleveland, returns Residual-Fit plot, optionally including centered observed values. well-known, fitting data means finding mathematical descriptions structure data. structural description data can distributions differ location spread shape, can fitted estimating location, .e. computing location measure distribution. Simply saying, \\(p^{th}\\) part data, let \\(h_{pi}\\) \\(^{th}\\) measurement height let \\(\\bar{h}_{p}\\) mean height also fitted value \\(h_{pi}\\). residuals deviations heights fitted values, .e. \\(\\hat{\\epsilon}_{pi}=h_{pi}-\\bar{h}_{p}\\).\nfitted values account variation heights attributable variable fitting process. residuals remaining variation data variation due shifting means removed.\n\nsimple example let us understand plot showing. Since subtraction means removed effect individuals, centered fitted values zeros. right residual plots shows remaining parts subtraction means, .e. reflection level variation.\ncan also another complicated example based fastfood dataset, seems compressed residual plot previous one, obviously relation total_fat sat_fat clearly far linearity.\nmake_coplot_df\ncreates dataframes used coplot, pretty useful causal inference tasks. start simple example see kind dataset can derived function.\n\ncan see, make_coplot_df returns list two dataframes. first dataframe data1 original fastfood dataset new column grouping intervels added end. dataframe data2 implies information grouping. Since inputs function similar previous, leave part show use created dataframes. Note dataframe, can immediately use basic coplot function, leads result gg_coplot, .e. following two plots exactly .\ngg_quantiles\nfunction returns quantile-quantile plot compare given number groups. Let us recall original QQ plot library ggplot2, following example, draw QQ plot calories data different restaurants.\n\ngg_quantiles function similar task ? answer , can see definition gg_quantiles, function aims compare given number groups QQ plot, .e. focus relations differences groups. provide following example using gg_quantiles show campares calories differnet restaurants.\n\nIndeed, large amount information can derived graph. Clearly, know QQ plots symmetric along diagonal. may find closely similar pairs, e.g. (Dairy Queen, Sonic), (Burger King, Subway), … Also, obvious higher calories pairs, e.g. (Dairy Queen, Mcdonalds), (Arbys, Mcdonalds), …\ngg_tmd\nfunction returns Tukey’s Mean-Difference plot one-way data. Tukey mean-difference plot (simply m-d plot) can add substantially visual assessment shift two distributions. Suppose two variables \\(b_{}\\) \\(t_{}\\) compared QQ plot, corresponding m-d plot, difference \\(b_{}-t_{}\\) graphed means \\(\\frac{b_{}+t_{}}{2}\\), line \\(b=t\\) QQ plot becomes zero line m-d plot. shift assessed judging deviations zero line. intuition behind m-d plot often enhances perception effects can readily judge deviations horizontal line line nonzero slope. concretely, see following example, directly extended QQ plot among restaurants.\n\nm-d plot, comparison two distributions can summarized simple statement distribution one variable heights greater lower one. good news since many examples show shifts distributions can complex.\n\nFinally, provide interesting example based environmental, one included datasets. brief description dataset can found CRAN document (ggcleveland) :\n1). measurements made 111 days May September 1973 sites New York City metropolitan region; one measurement variable day.\n2). Solar radiation amount 800 1200 frequency band 4000A-7700A, measured Central Park, New York City.\n3). Wind speed average values 700 1000, measured LaGuardia Airport, 7 km Central Park.\n4). Temperature daily maximum, also measured LaGuardia.\n5) .Ozone cube root average hourly values 1300 1500, measured Roosevelt Island, 2 km Central Park 5 km LaGuardia\".\n\nseems like environmental quite simple data, however, many works can done application ggcleveland. goal analyzing environmental data determine ozone depends variables. simple way visualize hypervariate data graph pair variables scatterplot, see\n\nlot information contained scatterplot matrix (spm) graph. example, subplot (1,3) Ozone Solar radiation, can receive two messages. First, highest values Ozone occur Solar radiation 200 300 langleys. Second, highest values Solar radiation, Ozone stays low levels. However, spm technique want focus , goal use algorithms ggcleveland. scatterplot matrix environmental data shows strong association Ozone Temprature Ozone Wind speed. seems likely factors explains variation data explained others.\nless evidence Solar radiation explains variation Ozone given Temprature Wind speed. example, saw upper envelope scatterplot Ozone Solar radiation explainable behavior Temprature Wind speed. photochemistry results Ozone requires Solar radiation, laws chemistry must obeyed, know principle Solar radiation causal factor. mean environmental data, Solar radiation measurements good predictors Ozone. Perhaps minimum amount Solar radiation needed, beyond , production sensitive amount.\nHence, need way see conditional dependence variables, .e. hypervariate coplot, see\n\n\\(\\textbf{refering source code *gg_coplot* **https://github.com/mpru/ggcleveland/blob/master/R/gg_coplot.R**, admit function unable draw conditional plot given two variables, indeed shortcoming newborn function}\\). Note conditioning intervals figure chosen using equal_count method target fraction overlap 0.4, thus, number values conditioning factor interval roughly constant. coplots shows rather convincingly Solar radiation explains variation Ozone measurements beyond explained Wind speed Temperature. Clearly, three coplots three factors Solar radiation, Temperature Wind speed.\n\nFitting essential visualizing hypervariate data fit hypervariate dataset hypervariate surface, function three variables, function Solar radiation, Wind speed Temperature. strategy displaying fitted hypervariate surface, exactly use conditioning. Suppose u one factors. can assign values factors, obtain graph u given assigned, conditioning values. \\(\\textbf{However, certain difficulty arose *coplot* unable add fitting curve (surface) *gg_coplot* able ; hand, *coplot* can condition two variables *gg_coplot* unable }\\). following example, address dilemma applying previous mentioned make_coplot_df method.\n\nalso many interesting experiments can conducted based gg_cleveland package. Visualization critical data analysis tools matter. exceptionally powerful visualization tools, also others, well known, rarely outperform best ones.
