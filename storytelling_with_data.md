# Storytelling with Data

Jessie Wang

Being able to tell the story behind the data is a very important skill for data scientists/ analysts. I received a lot of training on storytelling at previous work. I summarized some key points and put together a deck. It contains information on how to build a story, best practice on data visualization and slides, and how to make a successful presentation. Here is the link to the slides: https://github.com/jessiewyt/EDAV/blob/main/CC-Storytelling.pdf

My notes were from a brilliant session taught by Ravishankar Iyer. https://www.storyrules.com is the URL for his website if anyone is interested in learning more.
