In this blog, I've talked about alluvial diagrams. The basic idea was to focus on introducing the concept of alluvial plots to audience unaware of it. It contains the following questions:

1) What is an alluvial diagram?
2) Use cases of an alluvial diagram
3) Components of an alluvial diagram
4) How to implement them using the ggalluvial package in R?
5) Sources on building these diagrams using Python and MS Excel
