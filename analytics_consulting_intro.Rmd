# Introduction to analytics consulting at Accenture

Gabrielle Nyirjesy

I conducted a zoom session on Analytics Consulting where I shared what I have learned in my 5 years working at Accenture. Some of the topics discussed included the types of Data Science problems, working with real-world data, considerations for delivering solutions, and team structure and career progression.
