## Create new repo

Create a new repository by copying this template: http://www.github.com/jtr13/cctemplate and following instructions in the README.

Add these Imports to the real DESCRIPTION file.

Found problematic packages by looking at reverse dependencies of the packages that failed to install:

`devtools::revdep()`

Also used `pak::pkg_deps_tree()`

Problems:

`magick`

`rJava` dependency of `qdap`
