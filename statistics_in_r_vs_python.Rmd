# Statistics in R vs Python

Weiyi Jiang and Sicheng Li

Python and R are two most popular coding languages in Data Science. In this project, we propose a comparison between Python and R in different kinds of scenarios, including generating random numbers, time series analysis and basic machine learning. Furthermore, we visualize the comparizon with a cheat sheet for reference. During this project, we conducted the following both in R and Python:
1. Several random number generating methods including generating normal distribution and uniform distribution.
2. Time Series Analysis tools including ARIMA model, acf/pacf parameters,  adfuller test and Granger Causality test.
3. Machine Learning tools including Linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
