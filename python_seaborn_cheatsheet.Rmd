I created a cheat sheet for data visualization with Seaborn, a package in python. Including data preparation, plot aesthetics, categorical data plotting, statistical relationships plotting and further customizations. 

See the two pdf files in 'https://github.com/Elliot1h/EDAV-cc' for cheat sheet and citations. They can also be found in 'resources/python_seaborn_cheatsheet'.
