The community contribution for our team is to create a cheatsheet for the topic of log transformation.

Our work is to create a comprehensive guidance regarding log-transformation, with theoretical analysis, examples of manipulated dataset with plots and visualizations, real-world examples, and some thoughts about situations that can not be applied to. 


The link of the PDF version of the guidance would be the following:
